# YouTrack Telegram Bot ðŸ¤–

This project is a Kotlin-based bot that integrates your [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) instance with [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). It serves as a bridge, bringing important project updates directly into your Messenger and allowing you to interact with YouTrack without leaving your chat.

The application is built using **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** to ensure a clean separation between the core application logic and external services.
